## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Exercise 03 — data collection framework.** A graded catalogue of 145 datasets and 31 benchmarks
  behind one public page that works out what an India-first, 40-billion-parameter model would train
  on — how much text, what kind, which datasets, how to clean it, how to tokenise it, and how you
  would know it worked. Every figure carries `{value, unit, provenance, source}` and the renderer
  refuses to print a bare one; where a quantity has never been measured, the page says so rather
  than showing a plausible number.
- **Five data-handling invariants enforced in CI.** Training never touches eval data · nothing
  excluded may enter a commercial mix · every judgment carries its reasoning and confidence · a
  measurement must name what produced it · no source content is silently dropped. Each ships with a
  test proving it fails when broken.
- **The tokenizer tax, measured rather than cited.** All twenty-two scheduled languages now carry a
  real fertility number with a run id behind it — five tokenizers over IN22-Gen (source-original
  Indian text) and IN22-Conv (conversational), reported apart because register changes the answer.
  Our measurement puts the mean Indic tax at ×7.45 under cl100k and finds a better tokenizer removes
  78% of it, independently corroborating the published figures the atlas cites (8.0× and 73%); we
  measure Malayalam at ×13.0 on our own text, which is the paper's own headline example.
- **Gemma 4 is the worst Indic tokenizer of the three serious candidates.** ×2.49 mean tax against
  Sarvam-105B's ×1.81 and XLM-R's ×1.66, and ×8.84 worst-case against ×2.90. It is the assignment's
  named target, so `docs/DECISIONS.md` now prices the "continue-pretrain from Gemma-4-31B" fork with
  that number attached: continue-pretraining inherits the tokenizer, and the tokenizer is not free.
- **Contamination coverage is no longer `none`.** MILU's validation split is indexed — 411,442
  shingles from 8,923 items across 11 languages — so the gate guards something. 56 of those items
  fall under the 13-word window and would have been undetectable before the short-item fix.
- **Interactive explainers** rather than static tables and charts: the contamination
  gate you can try to defeat with your own sentence, a vocabulary optimum that moves as you change
  the model width, a quality filter that deletes twelve of twenty-two languages until the protected
  lane restores them, and a confidence ledger that narrows to the nine claims that would survive
  checking. Conventions recorded in `docs/EXPLAINER_PROMPT.md` and `docs/EXPLAINER_PATTERN.md`.


- **Wide content is no longer squeezed into a reading measure.** The page capped everything at
  860px, which is right for prose and wrong for a seven-column dataset table or a two-column figure
  — they were cramped while a thousand pixels sat empty either side. Figures, the appendix
  registers and the statement chapters' tables now widen to `min(1240px, 94vw)` on large screens
  while prose and captions stay at the measure, and the explainer's chart column grows from 384px
  to whatever is left rather than the prose lines getting longer. Below 1080px nothing changes.
- **Six themes, site-wide, every one contrast-checked.** Tokens moved out of the individual pages
  into one `/_shared/tokens.css` that the landing page and all three exercises link, so a colour
  decision is made once. The system light/dark pair stays the default, joined by soft light (warm
  off-white), tinted dark (deep navy, not pure black), high contrast (monochrome) and neon
  (near-black with luminous accents). The choice persists across the whole site and is applied
  before first paint, so there is no flash of the wrong theme. Promoting the tokens also fixed two
  WCAG failures that were still live on the landing page and exercises 01 and 02 — `--faint` at
  3.33:1 and `--accent` at 4.31:1, both already corrected in 03 and never propagated. Verified in
  the browser: five pages x four themes plus both system modes, all contrast-pass.
- **Five themes, and every one of them contrast-checked.** The system light/dark pair stays the
  default, joined by soft light (warm off-white rather than cool grey), tinted dark (deep navy, not
  pure black), high contrast (monochrome), and neon (near-black with luminous accents). The choice
  persists and is applied before first paint, so there is no flash of the wrong theme. Two rules
  make it safe rather than decorative: the `prefers-color-scheme` block is scoped so a chosen theme
  always wins, and each theme defines the whole token set instead of inheriting half of it. Every
  text token in every theme was generated from a palette that a contrast checker had already
  passed — four contrast failures had shipped in this exercise when values were picked by eye — and
  all six themes measure accessibility 100 in the browser.
- **A growth chapter.** The 40B is a seed, and the chapter follows it to the largest Indic model in
  four stages — dense, grow sparse, grow deep, frontier parity — using the state-preserving growth
  method of arXiv:2606.07404. The shape of the answer is the lesson: parameters rise 7.5×, the
  corpus rises 1.8×, and the natural Indian-language pool does not rise at all. One stage adds 80
  billion parameters and reads no additional text.
- **Two India-first tiers no frontier lab has a reason to build.** Indian knowledge systems
  (Ayurveda, Siddha, Jyotish, and the NDLI/DLI scanned archives) and Indian civilizational
  literature (Vedic corpus, classical Sanskrit, Upanishads, Dharmashastra). Both are OCR problems
  before they are data problems. The mixture is zero-sum, so their 5% comes off general web and
  synthetic Indic. One of them has **zero catalogued candidates** — not one of the 145 datasets
  supplies it.
- **A second lens on the mixture.** Ten tiers is more than a reader holds in mind, so each is also
  labelled *skills* or *knowledge*. The mixture now runs 40% skills / 60% knowledge, raised from 28%
  because the assignment names coding and agentic work as primary capabilities.
- **A comparison table for the corpus budget** (`records/scaling_reference.json`): thirteen models
  with their parameters, architecture and pre-training tokens, every row carrying its source. The
  finding that matters is that a corpus is not sized by the model reading it — Llama 3.1 trained 8B,
  70B and 405B on about the same 15T, and DeepSeek-V3 at 671B total read less than Gemma 3 27B.
- **The shopping list is filterable.** Chapter 5 was ten stacked tables and 109 rows; it now filters
  by tier and by what is blocking each dataset, with live counts on every chip and nothing hidden.
- **The catalogue view is grouped and searchable.** 145 identical marks in one wall carried their
  meaning entirely in hover. They are now grouped into labelled grade bands — each naming its own
  colour — with a search box, and an empty band says so rather than being silently absent.
- **Web design system** (`docs/DESIGN.md`): a shared Apple-style visual language — palette tokens,
  typography, components, interaction, and copy/tone rules — that every exercise's `web/` bundle
  follows.

### Changed

- **Exercise 03 is one page instead of three.** The decision and the evidence behind it were split
  across two dense pages of 25 sections; a reader could not find what to actually train on. It is now
  a single page of thirteen chapters and an appendix, each answering one question in the order a
  reader asks it — what we are building, how much text, how it grows, what goes into it, **which
  datasets**, what we may legally use, how to clean it, keeping the exam out of the training data,
  how to teach behaviour, how to tokenise it, how we would know it worked, what it costs, and what
  to do first. Old links still resolve: every retired anchor redirects to the chapter that absorbed
  it.
- **Every chapter has three layers**, so one page serves a reader meeting the subject today and one
  who trains models for a living: a plain headline and a single number, the interaction that proves
  it, and a closed *"The arithmetic"* holding the derivation, sources and caveats. Stepped content
  fell from 45 states (~21 screens) to 29 (~8.7), because states are now justified by the argument
  rather than filled to a quota.
- **The 40B is a seed, and its corpus is derived rather than asserted.** An earlier draft presented
  15 trillion tokens as the model's budget; 15T was the research's target for a 300B mixture of
  experts, so a growth ladder had been mislabelled as one model's options. The seed now sits at
  16.8T — Gemma 3's officially stated 14T for its 27B, plus 20% for one generation — and it is
  labelled an estimate with a stated method everywhere it appears, because Gemma 4 discloses no
  token count in either its technical report or its model card.
- **Four questions the site never answered now have chapters**: what may legally be used, what to
  train on after pre-training, what the whole thing costs and whether to build from scratch at all,
  and what to do first.

### Fixed

- **Machine translation was being counted as natural Indian text.** Sangraha ships 251B tokens of
  which 64B are verified human-origin; the rest is roughly 90B machine-translated from Wikimedia and
  72B romanised transliteration. The catalogue card records that split and the budget used the
  headline — while the mixture chapter argued, in the same page, that counting synthetic as natural
  is "the commonest way to overstate a corpus". The natural-Indic tiers now count verified
  human-origin tokens only, which takes that tier from 80.9% covered to **25.3%**. Both figures are
  kept: every tier reports what its headline totals would have claimed, because the gap between them
  is the finding.
- **The vocabulary trade was a stale hand calculation.** `docs/DECISIONS.md` works it once against a
  15T budget with a 25.3% India slice; both have since moved. It is now recomputed from the mixture
  on every export — 1.05T tokens, 175,048 H100-hours, about ₹3.0 crore — and the one input that
  cannot be measured is named on the page rather than buried, since it describes a candidate
  tokenizer nobody has trained.
- **The post-training budget was three tables of uncited numbers.** `docs/DECISIONS.md` states them
  with a tilde and cites nothing, and the page typed them as estimates whose source was *"the
  post-training plan"* — the document containing the number. They now say what they are, and a new
  state compares them against the two labs that published theirs. That comparison finds a real
  defect: Tulu 3 pairs preference data at 36% of its SFT size and this plan proposes 6.7%.
- **Fast scrolling skipped explainer states.** The active state was chosen by intersection with a
  band 10% of the viewport tall, so several steps could be inside it at once with the last one
  processed winning, and a step could pass through entirely between callbacks and never fire. It is
  now whichever step is nearest the viewport centre, which has neither failure.
- **White text on the dark-mode accent measured 3.01:1.** Wrong since the accent was darkened, and
  invisible because every previous audit happened to run in light mode. One `--on-accent` token now
  carries white on light and near-black on dark; both themes score 100 for accessibility.
- **Contamination gate missed short evaluation items.** An item shorter than the 13-word shingle
  window hashed to a single whole-text gram, which can never match a 13-gram drawn from a longer
  training shard — so a short benchmark question pasted verbatim into a shard was reported clean.
  The index now records the window width each item was hashed at and checks the document at each
  width; items too short to identify anything are refused and counted rather than silently
  accepted.
- **The framework answered a third of its own assignment.** The class brief scopes this exercise as
  the full lifecycle — pre-training, SFT, preference, safety and evaluation — and the exercise brief
  narrowed it to "the pre-training data mix". Every one of the 145 catalogue records already carried
  a training-stage tag (101 pre-training, 47 SFT, 17 RL, 15 evaluation, 1 safety); it was rendered in
  one place and read by no module, while the tier mapping silently dropped 36 records including every
  preference, RL-only and safety dataset. The catalogue is now grouped by stage and nothing is
  dropped without being reported. Recorded in full in `docs/DESIGN_CRITIQUE.md`.
- **Seventeen answers that were already written had never been published** — the SFT/DPO/RLVR
  budgets, the twelve script blocks that sum to the chosen vocabulary, the per-language fertility
  targets, the FLOP comparison, the vocabulary trade, six objective-specific cleaning rules, the
  safety and PII gate, the curriculum phases, and the evaluation trust matrix. All are extracted into
  data and rendered.
- **Seven statements that were false as shipped**, most introduced when the vocabulary sweep was
  anchored on a measurement and the consequence was not propagated: a section claiming the curve was
  unanchored while the next said it was anchored, "three tokenizers" beside a chart showing five, a
  corpus described as translated when it is source-original, and a landing-page honesty line wrong in
  all three of its parts.
- **Two interactions that defeated themselves**: the landing page printed the answer to the page's
  only predict-before-reveal question, and using that question's input suppressed the most concrete
  fact on the page.
- **Contrast failures across the palette.** Seven semantic tokens passed as fills and failed as text
  — `--accent` at 4.31:1, `--grade-b` at 2.99:1. Re-measured and darkened; the page now scores 100
  for accessibility and 100 for performance.
- **Every page claimed a build time it did not have.** `generated_at` was exported as `None` with a
  comment saying the caller would stamp it; no caller ever did. It is stamped at the I/O boundary
  now, leaving the bundle builder pure.
- **Accessibility failures found by an actual Lighthouse run**, not by inspection: 145 interactive
  marks below the minimum touch-target size, a `--faint` token at 3.33:1, inactive scrollytelling
  steps dimmed to 1.57:1, and white ribbon labels at 3.25:1 on amber. All four fixed; all three
  pages now score 100 on accessibility and 95–100 on performance.

### Changed

- **Unified the site's look.** The landing page and both exercises now share one design language
  (cool-gray/blue, system sans, soft-shadow panels), replacing exercise 01's prior warm-paper/serif
  theme. Added a consistent `← Back` link across pages.
- **Rewrote public-page copy for a general audience.** Page footers and copy now read as standalone,
  blog-style demos, so first-time visitors can follow them without any course context.
- **Depth demo (`s2.html`):** the linear↔ReLU toggle now animates as a smooth grid morph with stable
  framing, instead of an instant redraw that also resized the panels.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-10

First tagged release: two interactive exercises live on Vercel with a gated deploy pipeline.

### Added

- **Session 1 — Introductions:** four live, in-browser, dependency-free proofs of why neural
  networks work (nonlinearity, depth, learned embeddings, and the role of data).
- **Session 2 — Tokenization:** a single 10,000-token multilingual BPE shared across four
  languages, scored by cross-language fertility spread.
  - An ablation harness sweeping algorithm × representation × normalization × vocab size ×
    corpus weighting.
  - A **from-scratch BPE** (no tokenizer library), competitive with the HuggingFace baseline.
  - A zero-dependency widget: per-language ratios, the score calculation, and a searchable
    view of the full vocabulary.
- **Web hosting on Vercel:** one project serving every exercise's static bundle under its slug
  (`/01-introductions/`, `/02-tokenization/`) behind a minimal landing page, assembled by
  `deploy/vercel/build.sh`.
- **Continuous delivery:** automatic preview deployments per pull request; **on-demand,
  approval-gated** production deploys via the `Deploy to production` GitHub Actions workflow.
- **Tooling & conventions:** uv workspace (Python 3.12), ruff lint/format, pytest (unit +
  integration split), GitHub Actions CI, and a PR-only workflow documented in `AGENTS.md`.

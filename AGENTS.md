# AGENTS.md

Canonical conventions for this repo, shared across all coding agents (Claude Code reads it
via `CLAUDE.md`'s `@AGENTS.md` import; Cursor/Copilot via the pointer files). Keep it short.

## What this repo is

ERA V5 (The School of AI): a ~6-month program to pretrain an LLM from scratch. Weekly
exercises + a capstone training run. Program overview: `docs/BRIEF.md`. Each class's work
lives in a numbered exercise folder under `src/exercises/`.

## Environment

- **uv workspace**, Python **3.12**. One shared root `.venv`, one `uv.lock`.
- `uv sync` — install/resolve. `uv run <cmd>` — run inside the env. `uv add <pkg>` — add a dep (never hand-edit `uv.lock`).
- Each exercise is a workspace member matched by `members = ["src/exercises/[0-9][0-9]-*"]`.

## Repo layout & naming

- **Exercise folders:** `src/exercises/NN-slug/` — numeric, **zero-padded**, slugged (e.g. `01-introductions`). Zero-pad so lexical sort = numeric order.
- **Identical skeleton per exercise:** `BRIEF.md` (assignment) · `README.md` (what/how) · `pyproject.toml` (member) · code in one place (`src/` or `web/`) · `artifacts/` (gitignored outputs).
- **Shared code:** deferred — add `src/common/` (its own member) only when a 2nd exercise needs to reuse something. No premature abstraction.

## Three data concerns — keep them physically separate

- **Briefs/docs** → tracked (`docs/BRIEF.md` program-level, `<exercise>/BRIEF.md` per exercise).
- **Datasets** → top-level `data/`, **gitignored** (+ a tracked manifest/download script).
- **Outputs** (plots/checkpoints/logs) → `<exercise>/artifacts/`, **gitignored**.

## Python style (enforced by ruff — see `pyproject.toml`)

- PEP 8 style + naming: `snake_case` funcs/vars, `PascalCase` classes, `UPPER_SNAKE` constants, `_private` prefix.
- PEP 257 google-style docstrings on public modules/classes/functions.
- Modern typing (PEP 585/604): `list[int]`, `X | None` — no `typing.List`/`Optional`, no `from __future__ import annotations` on 3.12. Type all public signatures.
- Idioms: `pathlib` over `os.path`; f-strings; `logging` over `print` in library code; `if __name__ == "__main__":` guards.
- One `config.py` `@dataclass` per exercise; prefer dataclasses/dicts + small pure functions over deep class hierarchies; shallow trees.
- **Run before committing:** `uv run ruff check --fix .` and `uv run ruff format .`.

## Tests

- Each exercise owns `tests/`; `uv run pytest` from root tests everything.
- Split fast **unit** vs slower **integration** (`@pytest.mark.integration`). Run fast only: `uv run pytest -m "not integration"`.
- The ML-native integration test: **overfit a single batch for a few steps and assert loss collapses** (+ shape/checkpoint round-trip tests).

## CI/CD

- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): `uv sync` → `ruff check` → `ruff format --check` → unit → integration → `node --check` on any `web/js/*.js`.
- CD: **Netlify Git integration** (preview-per-PR, prod-on-main). Deployable web exercises publish their `web/` dir.

## Instruction files (this system)

- `AGENTS.md` (this file) is the single source of truth. `CLAUDE.md` = `@AGENTS.md`. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.cursor/rules/conventions.mdc` point here.
- Component-specific notes live in a nested `CLAUDE.md` inside that exercise folder.
- Machine-enforceable rules live in tooling (`pyproject.toml`), not prose — this file references the tooling rather than restating it.
